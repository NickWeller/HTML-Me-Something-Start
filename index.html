               <h2> Music </h2>
               <p> 
               I love playing guitar, bass, and recently singing. I've been in several bands since I've lived in Saint Louis (most recently @gilltheband) and I'm grateful to be a part of our vibrant music scene. I've been playing guitar on and off since 2007 but I have only recently started writing and performing music as of a few years ago. Creativity ebbs and flows but having this outlet in my life is truly a blessing.

               <h2> Reading </h2>
               <p> 
               I'm a voracious reader and you can often find me on my Kindle. I obsessively read non-fiction books about history and politics (currently on a Cold War kick), but from time to time I like reading a good novel. I've found it to be a great way to relax at the end of a long day. I can go into rabbit holes and research and read about a topic for months.

            <p> 
            I love to cook and try new recipes with my fiance. We both have been exploring Keto and low-carb recipes to lose weight and my world has been opened with how many options are available. When we're taking a break from Keto, we love to make fresh sourdough bread.

         <h2> Homebrewing </h2>
         <p> 
         I started homebrewing mead a couple years ago and I've come to love the process. All the precise measurements and ingredients come together over a period of a few months to create a delicious alcoholic drink. I give most of my friends and family a bottle for Christmas, its a great way to give a meaningful gift &#38 to save money.
